# dnn-information
Master's project at University of Cambridge on developing interpretability of DNNs using Information Theory

## Project Proposal
Read docs/project-proposal.pdf for details of the proposed projects

## Overview

Broadly, the project will replicate the interpretable network presented by De Fauw et al. (2018) and apply two variations to that network.

Performance will be measured between the variations, which present different intermediate representations in the case that ground-truth segmentatin maps are unavailable.

An Information Theory analysis will then be made on the three networks to examine whether behaviour is the same across all versions of the intermediate represenation, or whether the training regime behaves differently depending on the intermediate representation.
